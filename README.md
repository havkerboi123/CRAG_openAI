My implemntation of the Corrective retrieval augmented generation (CRAG) paper using no LLM wrapper but with simple openAI functions. 

Though the functions could be called by tool calling via another agent , a simple if-else apporach worked really well as well!

The vector database was already created thus the relevant is not added.
